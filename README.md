# BeatSearch
A different skin to BeatSaver that adds features/info such as:

* NPS for difficulties and for all modes other than standard
* Direct map key search
* Get rid of infinite scroll and adds pages (with a page selector)
* Improved layout for map searching (this can be subjective)
* 3D previewer link
* displays total number of maps by a user when you click on their name to browse all of their maps

This site will not display any beatsage maps as this site is for people who like playing maps made by other people. (Any beatsage maps that do show up are because it was not flagged and marked by beatsaver)
